-Carbon dioxide is portrayed as harfuml, but there isn't even one study that can be produced that shows carbon dioxide is a harmful gas.
-Normalization through desensitization. Very effective way to do this with a bunch of second graders is to take a picture of the Lion King, for instance, and the teacher might say "Do you know the music for this movie was written by a gay man?" The message is: I'm better at what I do because I'm gay.

-[Referring to former prisoner of war and torture victim, Senator John McCain] he doesn’t understand how enhanced interrogation works. I mean, you break somebody, and after they’re broken, they become cooperative.
-In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality.
